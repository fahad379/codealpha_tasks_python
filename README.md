# CodeAlpha Tasks Python Repository

This repository contains various Python tasks that I have completed as part of the CodeAlpha internship program.

## Tasks Included

### 1. **Calculate.py**
This script calculates the age based on the user's birthdate. It computes the difference in years, months, and days between the current date and the given birthdate.

### 2. **Currency Converter.py**
A Python script that converts between multiple currencies, including USD, EUR, CAD, PKR, and INR. It allows the user to input the source and target currency, along with the amount, to perform the conversion.

### 3. **Password Generator.py**
A Python script that generates a secure random password. The user can specify the length of the password and choose whether to include numbers, special characters, and uppercase/lowercase letters.
